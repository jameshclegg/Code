Command Reference? Copyright 1998-2001 GSI Lumonics, Inc.ScopeThis command reference refers to:SC2000 firmware Version 2.0CLI.EXE Version 2.0GSI Lumonics SC2000 LabVIEW Driver Library Version 2.0Active X Motion Assembler Component Version 2.00The Command Line Interface (CLI) and the Motion Assembler Component (MAC) incorporate assemblers that translate English language program commands into the binary language of the SC2000.  Each command in defined in the assembly language context and then in the binary context, but note that the SC2000 will only accept commands uploaded in the binary format.StatementsStatements are composed of one command and a variable number of parameters. There are no optional parameters for Scan Controller commands.  Conditional statements actually have two commands per statement and they are an exception.Parameter FormatParameters are either integers or floating point numbers. Parameters are typically transmitted to the Scan Controller as 8 byte command headers, 16 bit integers and 1.15 fixed point numbers although there are some exceptions. All parameters are literal values in a statement and they are separated from each other and from the command text by whitespace. Floating point numbers in an assembly language statement are always written in the standard fixed point format with the decimal point located after the ones position, one or more leading digits and one or more trailing digits. For example, ‘1.3’ ‘0.6’ and ‘4.55’ and ‘6,7’ are all acceptable floating point numbers. Examples of unacceptable floating point number format are ‘4.9e1’ ‘.5’ ‘5.’. Certain computer systems may be configured for European local, in which case the acceptable decimal point is the comma character. Integers in an assembly language statement can be written as decimal, character, octal or hexadecimal numbers. Decimal numbers may have a leading ‘+’ or ‘-‘ sign and 1 or more digits. For example, -45   +23   200   56000 are all acceptable decimal integers. Examples of unacceptable decimal integers include 56,000 and 56.000. Character integers are written as a single printable ASCII character surrounded by single quotes. Examples of acceptable character integers in an assembly language statement are ‘4’ ‘A’ and ‘!’. Examples of unacceptable character integers are ‘’’ and ‘\045’. Octal numbers are written with a leading ‘\0’ followed by the number in base 8. Examples of acceptable octal numbers are \050   \0233   \0456. Hexadecimal numbers are written using the c language style. They have a leading ‘0x’ followed by the hex digits. Examples of acceptable hex integers are 0x50 0xFFFF.DIGIT			=>	[0-9]OCTAL_DIGIT		=>	[0-7]HEX_DIGIT		=>	[0-9a-fA_F]DECIMAL_INTEGER	=>	[+-]*[0-9]+OCTAL_INTEGER	=>	[\][0][0-7]+HEX_INTEGER		=>	[0][xX][0-9afAF]+CHAR_INTEGER	=>	[‘][0-9a-zA-Z][’]FLOAT			=>	[0-9]+[\.\,][0-9]+ 
Explanation of Operational ModesOverview:	There are various modes of operation that overlap or are mutually exclusive depending upon those compared. Raster Mode:	A fundamental operating mode for either programs or immediate instructions in which all motion commands are directed to a specified axis.Vector Mode:	A fundamental operating mode for either programs or immediate instructions where motion commands are simultaneously directed to both the X and Y axis.Program Instruction Mode:	When a program is running the operational context of the instructions of the program will be Program Instruction Mode. In contrast, query commands and the system configuration commands cannot be executed from a program, i.e. they are not valid in Program Instruction Mode.Immediate Instruction mode:	This is the idle mode of the Scan Controller, when a program is not running. Typically, every command can be executed from this mode except those that deal exclusively with the operation of programs, i.e. Repeat, Nrepeat, End, and ExecuteSerialNumber.Dual Single Axis:     	This mode is only available when the ExecuteRasterPgm command is executed.  This mode is characterized by two raster programs running concurrently, one on each axis.Concurrent Instruction mode:	This mode comes about when a program is running and you try to enter a command over the communications interface. Typically, commands valid for this mode are the query commands, AbortPgm and ExitPGM.

The values are latched into the Scan Controller optical calibration registers by a positive edge trigger on any of  sync channels 9 – 12. Optical calibration values can be read by issuing the ?OpticalCal command. Capture and readback can occur in the idle mode or while a program is running, thereby providing a mechanism to know the position, accuracy and correction factor at any given time.Notes:The gain value read back is the integer representation of gain. Use the following formula to convert the integer to floating point gain:  .Notes:The position readback value is derived from the following formula: Where PRead is the position sensor reading reported by ?OpticalCal and ?Position, PRaw is the uncorrected position sensor reading and axis specifies either the X or Y axis.  See SetXPROffset, SetXPRGain, SetYPROffset, SetYPRGain or SetConfigVar.Example:		“?OpticalCal” -> 0x2D

When an error is discovered while a stored program is executing or while commands are being received over the communication link, all subsequent commands are ignored until a ?Status command is issued or the controller is power cycled. If the error occurs while a program is running, the program will continue to run until the ?status command is issued. If the SC2000 is in the error state (LED ON) ?status will return the error code of the command in error, halt any running programs, set the LED to OFF and unlock command processing.  If there is no error, ?status returns the success code of the last command executed.

CreateFlashPgmCommand Description:	The action of Create Flash Program is to initiate the storage mechanism in the Scan Controller so that a program may be saved to non-volatile memory on-board the Scan Controller.Valid Run-time ModesRaster ModeVector ModeDual Single Axis ModeProgram InstructionImmediate InstructionConcurrent InstructionYESYESNONOYESNOParameters:program_type	program_type identifies the type of program to be saved.program_typeAction0This is a Raster program1This is a Vector programprogram_id	program_id is the identification code or program name for the new flash program. The program_id is a number in the range 1–254.Syntax:			CreateFlashPgm program_type program_idExample:	CreateFlashPgm 1 ’a’Note:	Place CreateFlashPgm with a program type and a program id that you choose as the first statement in a group of commands that you wish to permanently store on the Scan Controller. All commands sent down to the Scan Controller will be saved in flash memory until the End command is encountered. The point of execution will pass to these commands when called with ExecutePGM or ExecuteRasterPgm.Note:	Programs placed in flash memory will remain available even after the Scan Controller is power cycled. Program Id 1 has a special purpose; commands saved with program id 1 will automatically execute when the Scan Controller is powered up.Note:	If Error Code not equal to zero, commands will not be saved. Please reclaim Flash space by power cycling the Scan Controller.
CreateFlashPgmBinary Interface:		Command Byte: 	0x1EParameters:		4 bytes as (2) big endian wordsTick count:		<timing dependent upon Baud rate>Return Count:		0Note:	Flash programs cannot be uploaded while a program is running.Note:	If CreateFlashPgm is executed with a program Id that already identifies a Flash program, the previous program will be marked for reclamation. Reclamation marking can also be forced by executing the ReleasePGM command. Space marked for reclamation will become available for new programs when the Scan Controller is power cycled. Example:		“CreateFlashPgm 1 100” -> 0x1E00010065

The Program ID is a number in the range 1–254.Syntax:			CreatePgm program_type Program_idNote:	CreatePgm is the first statement in a program that you wish to store in the SRAM portion of the Scan Controller memory. Programs stored in this area will be lost after a power cycle. CreatePgm initiates a special ‘transfer’ mode where commands sent after the CreatPgm statement are stored in SRAM rather the executing immediately. The special ‘transfer’ mode is terminated by the end statement. Note:	Programs stored in the SRAM area of the Scan Controller can be transferred from the host to the Scan Controller while another program is executing motion commands. This operation is undefined if you transfer a new program with the same name as the one being transferred. Note:	If Error Code is not equal to zero, commands will not  be saved.
CreatePgmBinary Interface:		Command Byte: 	0x21Parameters:		4 bytes as (2) big endian wordsTick count:		<timing dependent upon Baud rate>Return Count:		0Notes:Note:	If CreatePgm is called with a program Id that already identifies a SRAM program, the previous SRAM program will be marked for reclamation.  Reclamation marking can also be forced by executing the ReleasePGM command. Space marked for reclamation will become available for new programs by executing the PackMemory command or power cycling the Scan Controller. Note:	If a new program is uploaded with the same program ID as an existing Flash program, the program ID will reference the SRAM program until the Scan Controller is power cycled, after which the program ID will reference the Flash program once again.Example:		“CreatePgm 1 0xDE” -> 0x21000100DE
DelayedLaserGateCommand Description:	The DelayedLaserGate command is used to turn the laser on and off via the Laser Interface board. The mode parameter specifies the ON or OFF condition.

When the point of execution of the program reaches this command it is queued up for execution SetSetsyncDelay number of clock ticks (23.5us instruction clock) later; the point of execution then moves on to the next instruction in the program. After the  delay the instruction will wait a further count number of 240ns clock ticks and then assert the FPS line on the Laser Interface Board according to the FPS configuration specified in a previously issued LaserModeSetup command.Note:	This command will assert the FPS signal of the laser board. If the FM parameter of  the LaserModeSetup command equals 0 then the FPS signal will be a short pulse of about 1 us. If FM = 1 then the FPS signal will remain asserted (extended) until the first, second, third or fourth pulse of the PWM signal, after which it is automatically unasserted. Syntax:	DelayedSetFPS count

The graphic of each number is defined in a bounding box, the start and end coordinates of a number program are always in the same place relative to the bounding box, the start position being at the center left side and the end being at the center right side; thus it is possible to execute program in sequence and have drawn a multi-digit number with proper kerning and alignment. Before the first number of the serial number is drawn the laser must be positioned to the center left of the first cell, use either absolute or relative positioning commands to do this.  When marking of the serial number is complete the laser will be positioned at the center right side of the bounding box of the last character in the number. Internal to the SC2000, the serial number register will be incremented by one.Syntax:			ExecSerialNumber

This id is then used with ExecutePgm to invoke the stored code. Program Ids assigned to programs stored in either flash or RAM range from 1 to 254. If ExecutePgm is called with a program id that is out of range or that has no code previously stored, then an error will be generated and nothing gets executed. If another program is currently running an error will be returned. Also an error is generated if ExecutePgm is called with a pgm id that doesn’t obey the rules for pgm id stated above.

Termination of the program can be determined over the communications link by issuing the ?Status command. ?Status will report back ExitPgm Success (000000250000) when the program finally terminates. Note:	When ExitPgm is issued while a program is not running and then ?Status is entered next, the command field in the status report will not be set to ExitPgm but rather the last command executed befoe the ExitPgm command. Note:	ExitPGM works by suppressing the iteration property of the Repeat statement and the pause for synchronization property of the WaitSync[1-4] statement. Note that only sync channels 1-4 are suppressed; if ExitPGM is applied to a program that is waiting on a sync channel in the range 5-12, the external stimulus will have to be applied to the channel or the AbortPGM command will have to be used.

All timings are based upon a timebase with a period of 240nS. Flexible definition of the PWM waveform is provided by giving the definition three parameters, the overall period of the waveform, the time from the start of the waveform to the rising edge of the PWM signal and the time from the start of the waveform to the falling edge of the signal. The timing of the signal is shown in the following diagram.
Figure 1. Parameterization of PWM waveform	As shown in the figure, the use of three parameters in the definition of a rectangular wave allows greater flexibility in the timing of PWM pulses. This is especially important when the FPS Extension mode extends into the initial pulse train of the PWM signal. Additionally there are some special combinations of parameters that cause the PWM output to be 100% or 0%.
